# [School 21 Enrollment](https://21-school.ru/)

In a way, this repository will be a squeeze of what the pool at School 21 is all about, and I'll also point out some of the most important projects. Over the course of a month, peers learn the basics of programming, as well as comprehend softskills. Before the pool, it is advised to prepare for it minimally ([take a course on steppic](https://stepik.org/course/3078/info)), and and to allocate time.

The training plan:  
Bash + git -> basic C functions -> pointers -> memory allocation -> address arithmetic -> two-dimensional arrays -> header files -> makefile -> structures -> file manipulation. The training is too intense for a beginner, so learning the basics beforehand is helpful.

Learning structure:  
Monday - Thursday => solo projects to learn the material  
Friday => exam on the studied material  
Saturday - Sunday => team project  

Reasons to go to the intensive, in my opinion, are community + learning the basics quickly + being able to write structured code + being able to force yourself to study + familiarizing yourself with sanitizers, clang format, makefile. 

The repository also includes 3 team projects that literally show the process of improving the ability to write code. Initially it's a terrible + unreadable project ([Ping Pong](https://github.com/Xonesent/School-21-Enrollment/tree/master/1%20Ping%20Pong)), then +- structured with little but file work ([Game of life](https://github.com/Xonesent/School-21-Enrollment/tree/master/2%20Game%20of%20life)) and finally a project consisting of several .c + .h files and teamwork ([Polish notation](https://github.com/Xonesent/School-21-Enrollment/tree/master/3%20Polish%20notation)).
